## 🧬 Analysis of GSE81089 

### Project Overview 
This repository contains a pipeline for processing of raw RNA-seq data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).  
**Note:** For the purpose of demonstrating this pipeline, a subset of 10 samples was selected from the primary study GSE81089.

### Biological Context
The original study aimed to investigate the expression of cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using RNA-seq. CTAs are genes that are normally restricted to testicular tissue but can be aberrantly expressed in cancer. 
In this project, the dataset is used only to demonstrate RNA-seq data processing and analysis steps, without reproducing the biological analyses of the study.

### Dataset Information
**GEO Accession:** GSE81089  
**Organism:** _Homo sapiens_  
**Experiment type:** Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing (RNA-seq)  
**Library layout:** Paired-end
